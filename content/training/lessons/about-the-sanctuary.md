First established in 1972, the National Marine Sanctuary System has grown to include a system of sanctuaries and marine national monuments across the country. Managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (or “NOAA”), the mission of these marine protected areas cover more than 600,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters from Washington State to the Gulf of Mexico, and from Lake Huron to American Samoa. Ranging in size from less than one square mile to 582,000 square miles, each sanctuary site is a special place, managed to conserve, protect, and enhance biodiversity, ecological integrity and cultural legacy.
