We're working on bringing this site to life!

Blue Star is a recognition program by the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and this is the official site through which dive shop, fishing charters, eco tours, and volunteers can take training to get involved.

## Here are some of the things we're working on to make the site more useful to you

### Dive and Fish Staff
- Get automatic reminder when it's time to complete the online training again. A simple email, no repeated nagging.
- Start and stop. Take a lesson now, finish the rest later. In any order you like.

### Dive and Fish Managers
- Research backed marketing ideas and resources
- Tools to help manage your yearly requirements and renewals

### Visitors
- Learn more about the Blue Star program
- Sign a pledge showing your support for coral reef ecosystem conservation
