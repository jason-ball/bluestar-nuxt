# Blue Star Online Training

This is the online training platform for the FKNMS Blue Star program. Dive shops and fishing charters originating in and operating in the Florida Keys Naitonal Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) are elegible to be part of the Blue Star program.

Requirements are slightly different based on the industry, but are a collection of best practices for each that go beyond the bare minimum rules and regulations.

Participants in the Blue Star programs provide exceptional customer experiences and set a good example. They protect the resources for the future and show how they can be enjoyed responsibly today.

## Contributing Guide

Code contributions are welcome and encouraged.

This project uses the typical github flow:

- Clone the project to your local machine
- Install dependencies
- Work on a feature, bugfix, or documentation
- Create a pull request

The code stack is Nuxt, Express, MongoDB. Having a good foundation in Vue and Node are helpful. TailwindCSS is used for styling components, and a design system is a work in progress.

> A major feature would be creating a Docker image for this project to make getting contributors up to speed quicker.

Content is developed internally with contributions and references from across the wider scientific and regulatory communities.

> Content contributions have been made by FWC, NOAA, Mote Marine Laboratory, Coral Restoration Foundation, Florida DEP, and the staff of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

If you have a content contribution idea, feel free to explore it but please reach out first. Because Blue Star has specific program goals within FKNMS, which is itself a government agency, there are strict guidelines that must be followed.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
